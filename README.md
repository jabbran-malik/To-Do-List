ToDo List Application

A modern, interactive ToDo List web app built with JavaScript ES6 modules, Webpack, and CSS.
This project demonstrates modular coding, CRUD operations, dynamic DOM manipulation, local storage persistence, and secure deployment using GitHub Pages with HTTPS.

It’s a fully functional, responsive, and secure task manager that allows users to add, edit, delete, mark complete/incomplete tasks, and clear all completed tasks—all while keeping changes persistent across browser reloads.
